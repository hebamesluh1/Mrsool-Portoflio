                            One day, Nayef was telling Ayman a story about the hassles he had to go through when he had to drive a long way to get something done, then he said, why don't we have a solution for this? What if you have a brother in every corner of the city? This time Ayman couldn't turn down that idea. <span>It was as if a bright light bulb went on their heads! Mrsool was born at that very moment</span>
                        </p>
                        <p>During the development, Ayman was working full time at a hospital and he just had his firstborn son, and a few hours before an important presentation he was supposed to deliver to the top management of the hospital, his wife called him, telling him that they ran out of milk for the baby, he had to leave the office at the downtown, drive all the way to get milk for the baby and back to the office.</p>
                        <p>At that exact moment, he realized that if he had Mrsool, he would have used the app to get out of that bad situation! And 5 months after that, the app was live!</p>

                        <h5>What does "Mrsool" mean?</h5>
                        <p>
                            MRSOOL comes from the Arabic root Rasl which means ‚Äúto send‚Äù, variations of the word from the root could mean ‚Äúmessenger‚Äù, ‚Äúdelegate‚Äù or ‚Äúenvoy‚Äù. As the word implies, you are delegating someone on your behalf to do something for you, be it to purchase and deliver dinner üç≤, buy medicine from the pharmacy, or even fetch your spare keys üîë on the unfortunate event of locking yourself out of your car üöò!
                        </p>
